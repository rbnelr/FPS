*Ground Collisions
*Horizontal (Walls) Collision
*Ceiling Collision
*Limit Walking up slopes to a max slope

*Movement dynamics
* smooth acceleration that is still responsive

Spring-like reaction to hitting ground
Smooth Stepping over small obstacles

smooth acceleration that is still responsive
 -can be improved with acceleration curves maybe
  -180 vel changes get higher accel to make strafing tighter
 -or maybe instead of capping acceleration to a low value (which just causes a kind of sluggish feeling) control the target velicity better
  1. short presses of wasd while standing still should result in a small target vel for precice movement
  2. sprint should always result in a large target vel quickly to allow fast speed up / down if desired
  3. sprint should only allow you to go faster forwards not backwards (maybe?, unidirectionality might also be desired)
  4. to allow quick strafing to dodge, maybe give a boost to accel when switching movement direction 180 deg
   4.1 also allow this for forw/back movement switches ?
   4.2 should not interfere with 1. though, an interesting approach is to literally do vel = -vel; for this "boost" or rather vel = length(vel) * new_vel_dir;


 
 walking up slopes slower
 reaction to running into walls?
 ground differences (slippery ice, sticky ground)


Ducking

Air Control (no air control by default, or air control if desired)

Walking up stairs should have the player be constantly "Grounded" and their velocity should follow the stair slope so that jumping works normally (ie. stairs should act like a ramp even though theyre not)
